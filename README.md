# OpsAgent: Your AI-Powered On-Call Co-pilot

OpsAgent is a smart assistant designed to help IT and DevOps teams resolve incidents faster. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to understand incoming support tickets, find relevant information from your internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and draft a high-quality, context-aware response ready for human approval.

This MVP is built with Python, FastAPI, Docker, and powered by Google's Gemini LLM. It's designed to be a lightweight, deployable, and extensible foundation for building more complex agentic workflows.
